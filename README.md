Objective: The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans which means we have to build a model which will be used to predict which customer will most likely to accept the offer for personal loan, based on the specific relationship with the bank across various features given in the dataset. Here I will be using the Supervised Learning methods to predict which model is best for this problem amongst Logistic Regresssion, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Random Forest and Decision Tree.
